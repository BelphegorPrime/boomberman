# GitHub Issues for Boomberman Improvements

## ðŸš¨ High Priority Issues

### Issue #1: Enhanced Bot Detection System
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `security`, `high-priority`  
**Milestone:** Phase 1 - Foundation Improvements  
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimated Time:** 5-8 hours

#### Description
The current bot detection only checks user-agent strings, which is easily bypassed. We need a more sophisticated system that analyzes multiple request characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement HTTP header fingerprinting (15+ headers analyzed)
- [ ] Add request timing analysis to detect sub-human speeds
- [ ] Create suspicion scoring system (0-100 scale)
- [ ] Add behavioral pattern detection
- [ ] Maintain <1% false positive rate for legitimate traffic
- [ ] Include comprehensive test coverage

#### Technical Requirements
```typescript
interface BotDetectionResult {
  isSuspicious: boolean;
  suspicionScore: number; // 0-100
  reasons: string[];
  fingerprint: string;
}
```

#### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/middleware/advancedBotDetection.ts` (new)
- `src/utils/fingerprinting.ts` (new)
