# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Bot Detection System will significantly improve Boomberman's ability to identify and classify automated attacks while maintaining minimal false positives for legitimate traffic. This system will replace the current basic user-agent checking with a sophisticated multi-factor analysis approach that examines HTTP headers, request timing, behavioral patterns, and geographic indicators to create a comprehensive threat assessment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to analyze HTTP request fingerprints beyond user-agent strings, so that I can detect sophisticated bots that spoof basic browser characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is received THEN the system SHALL analyze at least 15 HTTP headers including Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, Connection, Cache-Control, and User-Agent
2. WHEN analyzing headers THEN the system SHALL detect missing common browser headers that indicate automation
3. WHEN automation framework signatures are detected THEN the system SHALL flag requests containing Selenium, Puppeteer, or similar tool indicators
4. WHEN header combinations are inconsistent with legitimate browsers THEN the system SHALL increase the suspicion score accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to perform behavioral analysis on request patterns, so that I can identify automated attacks based on timing and navigation behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests arrive faster than humanly possible THEN the system SHALL flag sub-human timing patterns
2. WHEN sequential endpoint access follows automated patterns THEN the system SHALL detect and log unusual navigation flows
3. WHEN rapid-fire requests are detected from the same source THEN the system SHALL increase threat scoring
4. WHEN request intervals are too consistent THEN the system SHALL identify machine-like timing patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want geographic IP analysis integrated into threat detection, so that I can identify attacks from high-risk locations and infrastructure providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an IP address is analyzed THEN the system SHALL determine geographic location using MaxMind GeoLite2 or equivalent service
2. WHEN requests originate from VPN, proxy, or hosting providers THEN the system SHALL flag these as higher risk
3. WHEN geographic data is available THEN the system SHALL create location-based risk scoring
4. WHEN attacks come from known high-risk countries or regions THEN the system SHALL adjust threat scores accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want a comprehensive suspicion scoring system, so that I can prioritize threats and make automated response decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all detection factors are analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate a suspicion score from 0-100
2. WHEN multiple risk factors are present THEN the system SHALL combine scores using weighted algorithms
3. WHEN legitimate traffic is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain less than 1% false positive rate
4. WHEN scoring thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate response actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable detection sensitivity, so that I can adjust the system for different environments and threat levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detection rules are configured THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of scoring weights and thresholds
2. WHEN whitelist entries are added THEN the system SHALL bypass detection for legitimate monitoring tools
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply updates without requiring restart
4. WHEN detection parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL log configuration changes for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and metrics, so that I can monitor detection performance and tune the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detection analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL log detailed reasoning for suspicion scores
2. WHEN false positives or negatives are identified THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient data for analysis
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track detection accuracy, response times, and resource usage
4. WHEN detection events occur THEN the system SHALL generate structured logs suitable for SIEM integration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want TLS fingerprinting capabilities, so that I can detect advanced bots that may bypass HTTP-level detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TLS connections are established THEN the system SHALL capture TLS fingerprint data where available
2. WHEN TLS fingerprints match known bot signatures THEN the system SHALL increase suspicion scoring
3. WHEN TLS and HTTP fingerprints are inconsistent THEN the system SHALL flag potential spoofing attempts
4. WHEN TLS analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain performance within acceptable limits
